# Emotion Classification

I will be working on a computer vision problem that involves classifying human emotions. Deep learning algorithms will be applied to the KDEF dataset. The KDEF data set can be found here: http://kdef.se/

The 'Digital Filters' jupyter notebook applys various  digital filters to images from the KDEF dataset.
