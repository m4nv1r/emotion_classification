# Emotion Classification

I will be working on a computer vision problem that involves classifying human emotions. Deep learning algorithms will be applied to the KDEF dataset. The KDEF data set can be found here: http://kdef.se/

The 'Digital_Filters' jupyter notebook applys various  digital filters to images from the KDEF dataset. 

The 'Facial_Landmarks' jupyter notebook shows the image preprocessing steps that will be used and gives an example of how 68 landmarks on a face will be identified.
